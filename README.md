# Impact Cycling
Track your biking, save the world.

## Installation
Impact Cycling runs Python 3 and uses the lightweight web framework Flask. To
start developing, clone the repository, install the required libraries, and runs
`python impact_cycling.py`. This should start the server on localhost port 5000.

## About
This project was started at CarlHacks 2017, and is currently being restructured
into a less hastily designed application!

The goal of Impact Cycling is to encourage your personal biking habits by
visualizing the distance you've covered and the positive impact it has had on
you and the world around you.
